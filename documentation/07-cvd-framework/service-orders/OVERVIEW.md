The CVD service order system provides comprehensive cabinet-centric service management, enabling efficient inventory restocking, maintenance scheduling, and photo verification through an integrated workflow that optimizes driver routes and operational efficiency.

## System Purpose

The service order system serves as the operational backbone for fleet maintenance and inventory management, enabling:

- **Cabinet-Centric Operations**: Organize service tasks by individual cabinet units rather than entire devices
- **Intelligent Pick List Generation**: Automatically calculate product requirements based on planogram data
- **Route Optimization**: Coordinate service orders with driver routes for maximum efficiency
- **Photo Verification**: Validate service completion with photographic evidence
- **Real-Time Inventory Updates**: Sync completed services with planogram quantities

## Core Capabilities

### Cabinet-Level Task Management
- **Granular Service Control**: Service individual cabinets within multi-cabinet devices
- **Independent Scheduling**: Each cabinet can be serviced separately based on specific needs
- **Targeted Product Lists**: Generate precise restocking requirements per cabinet
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor completion status at cabinet level for detailed progress tracking

### Intelligent Pick List System
- **Par Level Analysis**: Calculate requirements based on current quantity vs. par level settings
- **Product Aggregation**: Combine requirements across multiple cabinets for efficient picking
- **Category Organization**: Sort pick lists by product category for warehouse optimization
- **Quantity Optimization**: Account for capacity constraints and service frequency

### Integration Architecture
- **Planogram Integration**: Direct connection with slot configuration and inventory levels
- **Route Management**: Seamless integration with driver route planning
- **Photo Verification**: Mobile app integration for service completion validation
- **Analytics Integration**: Feed completed service data into performance analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Service Order Structure
```python
# Service Order Hierarchy
Service Order (Route-Level)
    ↓
Service Order Cabinets (Cabinet-Level Tasks)
    ↓
Service Order Cabinet Items (Product Requirements)
    ↓
Service Visits (Completed Service Records)
```

### Database Schema
- **service_orders**: Main order records with route and driver assignments
- **service_order_cabinets**: Cabinet-specific service tasks
- **service_order_cabinet_items**: Product requirements per cabinet
- **service_visits**: Completed service records with verification photos

### API Integration
- **Frontend Interface**: `pages/service-orders.html` for order management
- **Backend Service**: `service_order_service.py` for business logic
- **Mobile Integration**: Driver PWA for field execution
- **Real-Time Updates**: Cross-frame communication for immediate status updates

## Key Features

### Cabinet-Centric Approach

#### Multi-Cabinet Device Support
```python
# Example: 3-Cabinet Device Service
Device 123: Coffee/Snack/Beverage Machine
├── Cabinet 0: Coffee (needs service)
├── Cabinet 1: Snacks (fully stocked)
└── Cabinet 2: Beverages (needs service)

Service Order includes only Cabinets 0 and 2
```

#### Independent Cabinet Operations
- Service cabinets independently based on individual needs
- Different service types per cabinet (restocking, maintenance, repair)
- Flexible scheduling allows cabinet-specific service intervals
- Detailed tracking of cabinet-level performance and service history

### Pick List Generation

#### Automated Requirements Calculation
```python
# Pick List Logic
for each cabinet in service_order:
    for each slot in planogram:
        if current_quantity < par_level:
            quantity_needed = par_level - current_quantity
            add_to_pick_list(product_id, quantity_needed)
```

#### Product Aggregation
- Combine identical products across multiple cabinets
- Organize by category for efficient warehouse picking
- Account for capacity constraints to prevent overstocking
- Generate optimized picking routes within warehouse

#### Pick List Optimization
```python
# Optimized Pick List Structure
{
    'beverages': [
        {'product': 'Coca-Cola', 'quantity': 45, 'locations': ['Cabinet 0-A1', 'Cabinet 2-B3']},
        {'product': 'Pepsi', 'quantity': 30, 'locations': ['Cabinet 0-A2', 'Cabinet 2-B4']}
    ],
    'snacks': [
        {'product': 'Doritos', 'quantity': 25, 'locations': ['Cabinet 1-C1', 'Cabinet 1-C2']}
    ]
}
```

## Service Order Workflow

### Order Creation Process

1. **Route Selection**: Choose target route for service order generation
2. **Cabinet Selection**: Select specific cabinets requiring service across route devices
3. **Pick List Generation**: System calculates aggregated product requirements
4. **Order Optimization**: Estimate service time and resource requirements
5. **Driver Assignment**: Assign order to route driver with mobile app notification

### Service Execution Workflow

1. **Order Reception**: Driver receives service order on mobile PWA
2. **Product Picking**: Warehouse staff prepare products using generated pick list
3. **Route Navigation**: Driver follows optimized route with cabinet-specific stops
4. **Service Execution**: Complete service tasks with real-time quantity updates
5. **Photo Verification**: Capture completion photos for quality assurance
6. **Status Updates**: Real-time synchronization with fleet management system

### Quality Assurance

#### Photo Verification System
- **Before/After Photos**: Document service completion with visual evidence
- **Product Placement**: Verify proper product stocking and arrangement
- **Equipment Status**: Document equipment condition and any maintenance needs
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure adherence to service standards and procedures

#### Real-Time Validation
- **Quantity Verification**: Cross-check delivered quantities against requirements
- **Product Accuracy**: Validate correct products placed in designated slots
- **Service Standards**: Ensure completion of all required service tasks
- **Exception Reporting**: Flag discrepancies for immediate resolution

## Advanced Features

### Service Order Preview

#### Pre-Service Analysis
```javascript
// Service Order Preview Data
{
    'totalDevices': 5,
    'totalCabinets': 8,
    'estimatedUnits': 150,
    'estimatedTime': 120, // minutes
    'pickList': [...],
    'routeOptimization': {...}
}
```

#### Resource Planning
- **Time Estimation**: Calculate service duration based on cabinet count and complexity
- **Product Requirements**: Pre-calculate inventory needs for efficient preparation
- **Route Optimization**: Plan optimal service sequence to minimize travel time
- **Resource Allocation**: Determine vehicle capacity and staffing requirements

### Service Order Execution

#### Mobile Driver Interface
- **Interactive Checklist**: Guide drivers through cabinet-specific service tasks
- **Real-Time Updates**: Update planogram quantities as service progresses
- **Exception Handling**: Record and report service issues or discrepancies
- **Offline Support**: Continue service operations without network connectivity

#### Progress Tracking

# Service Progress States
'pending': Service order created, awaiting execution
'in_progress': Driver has begun service execution
'partially_complete': Some cabinets serviced, others remaining
'completed': All cabinets serviced and verified
'exception': Service issues requiring attention
```
