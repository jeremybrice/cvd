# AI Chatbot Data Usage Process Analysis

## **Complete Data Flow Process**

### **1. Data Collection Phase**
When a user sends a message, the chatbot automatically gathers comprehensive business context through parallel API calls:

```javascript
// Frontend collects all business data simultaneously
const context = await getBusinessContext();
const [weeklyMetrics, timeline, achievements, topPerformers, salesSummary, devices] = await Promise.all([
    chatApi.makeRequest('GET', '/metrics/weekly'),
    chatApi.makeRequest('GET', '/metrics/timeline'), 
    chatApi.makeRequest('GET', '/metrics/achievements'),
    chatApi.makeRequest('GET', '/metrics/top-performers'),
    chatApi.makeRequest('GET', '/sales/summary'),
    chatApi.makeRequest('GET', '/devices')
]);
```

### **2. Context Assembly**
The system packages this data into a structured context object:
- **Weekly metrics**: Revenue, sales volume, performance indicators
- **Timeline data**: Historical trends and patterns
- **Achievements**: Business milestones and goals
- **Top performers**: Best devices and products
- **Sales summary**: Aggregate sales statistics
- **Device fleet**: Complete device inventory with locations/routes
- **Page context**: Current application page user is viewing

### **3. Knowledge Base Integration**
The backend merges business data with comprehensive system knowledge:
- **Page-specific guidance**: 8+ application modules with features and workflows
- **Common workflows**: Step-by-step task instructions
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Solutions for common issues
- **Feature reference**: Complete functionality documentation

### **4. AI Processing**
Data is sent to Claude Opus 4 with structured prompt containing:
- User's original question
- Complete business context
- System knowledge base
- Current page context

## **Example: Complete Data Flow**

### **User Question**: *"Which devices need restocking and what's our best route?"*

### **Step 1: Data Collection**
System automatically pulls:
```json
{
  "weeklyMetrics": {
    "totalRevenue": 15420.50,
    "totalSales": 2847,
    "devicePerformance": {...}
  },
  "devices": [
    {
      "asset": "111",
      "location": "Downtown Mall",
      "route": "Route A",
      "slotMetrics": {
        "inventoryLevel": 23.5,
        "daysRemainingInventory": 2.1,
        "dailyConsumptionRate": 12.4
      }
    },
    {
      "asset": "222", 
      "location": "University Campus",
      "route": "Route B",
      "slotMetrics": {
        "inventoryLevel": 78.2,
        "daysRemainingInventory": 8.3,
        "dailyConsumptionRate": 8.7
      }
    }
  ],
  "topPerformers": {
    "devices": [
      {"asset": "111", "revenue": 2340.20},
      {"asset": "555", "revenue": 1890.15}
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Knowledge Base Enhancement**
System adds relevant guidance:
```json
{
  "route_optimization": {
    "description": "Optimize delivery routes for efficiency",
    "tips": [
      "Group nearby devices on same route",
      "Consider device status when planning visits",
      "Critical devices (red) need immediate attention"
    ]
  },
  "page_context": {
    "current_page": "route-schedule",
    "available_features": ["interactive_map", "device_selection", "status_indicators"]
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: AI Processing**
Complete context sent to Claude:
```
System: You are a comprehensive assistant for a small vending machine operation...

Business Context:
- Device 111: 23.5% inventory, 2.1 days remaining (CRITICAL)
- Device 222: 78.2% inventory, 8.3 days remaining (GOOD)
- Route A includes Device 111 (high priority)
- Current page: Route scheduling with map view available

User: "Which devices need restocking and what's our best route?"
```

### **Step 4: Generated Response**
AI analyzes the data and responds:
```
"Based on your current inventory levels:

üö® IMMEDIATE RESTOCKING NEEDED:
- Device 111 (Downtown Mall): Only 2.1 days of inventory remaining
- Device 333 (Airport): 1.8 days remaining

üìç OPTIMAL ROUTE RECOMMENDATION:
Start with Route A - it includes your most critical device (111) and two others nearby. Use the interactive map on your current Route Schedule page to visualize the stops.

üí° INSIGHT: Device 111 is both critically low AND your top revenue performer ($2,340 this week) - prioritize this stop first."
```
