- Sub-3-second device configuration load times
- Complete device lifecycle audit trails

## Feature Specifications

### F1: Device Registration and Creation
**User Story**: As a fleet manager, I want to register new vending machines in the system with complete configuration details, so that I can track and manage all assets in my fleet.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given device details (asset ID, cooler number, location, model), when I create a device, then unique asset ID is enforced and device is saved with current timestamp
- Given duplicate asset ID, when device creation is attempted, then validation error is returned with clear message
- Given device creation, when device is saved, then audit log entry is created with creating user information
- Given device creation, when cabinet configuration is included, then cabinet details are validated and associated with device

**Priority**: P0 (Core business requirement)
**Dependencies**: Device types, cabinet types, locations tables
**Technical Constraints**: Asset IDs must be globally unique, validation must prevent duplicates
**UX Considerations**: Clear form validation, guided input for required fields

### F2: Multi-Cabinet Configuration
**User Story**: As a device technician, I want to configure multiple cabinets for a single device, so that I can accurately represent complex vending machine setups with different cabinet types.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given device that allows additional cabinets, when adding cabinet configuration, then up to 3 cabinets can be configured per device
- Given cabinet configuration, when saved, then cabinet index, type, dimensions (rows/columns) are validated and stored
- Given existing cabinet configuration, when modified, then changes are tracked and previous configuration is preserved in audit log
- Given cabinet deletion, when requested, then dependent planogram data is handled according to cascade rules

**Priority**: P0 (Core operational requirement)
**Dependencies**: Cabinet types table, planogram system
**Technical Constraints**: Maximum 3 cabinets per device, cabinet indices must be unique per device
**UX Considerations**: Visual cabinet configuration interface, clear indication of cabinet limits

### F3: Soft Delete with Recovery
**User Story**: As an administrator, I want to soft-delete devices instead of permanently removing them, so that I can recover accidentally deleted devices and maintain audit trails.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given device deletion request, when processed by admin, then device is marked as deleted with timestamp and deleting user
- Given soft-deleted device, when viewed by non-admin users, then device is not visible in standard device lists
- Given soft-deleted device, when admin views deleted devices, then device can be seen and recovered
- Given device recovery, when processed, then deleted_at and deleted_by fields are cleared and device becomes active

**Priority**: P1 (Data protection requirement)
**Dependencies**: Admin role permissions, audit logging
**Technical Constraints**: Soft-deleted devices must be excluded from operational queries
**UX Considerations**: Clear indication of deleted status, easy recovery interface for admins

### F4: Location Management Integration
**User Story**: As an operations manager, I want to assign and manage device locations with full address and coordinate information, so that I can track fleet deployment and optimize routes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given device creation/editing, when location is selected, then device is associated with location record
- Given location change, when saved, then change is tracked in audit log with old and new location information
- Given location with assigned devices, when location is modified, then all associated devices reflect updated location information
- Given location deletion attempt, when location has assigned devices, then deletion is prevented with clear message

**Priority**: P0 (Operational requirement)
**Dependencies**: Locations table with address and coordinate data
**Technical Constraints**: Location foreign key constraints must be enforced
**UX Considerations**: Location search and selection interface, map integration for visual confirmation

### F5: Route Assignment
**User Story**: As a route planner, I want to assign devices to service routes, so that drivers know which devices they are responsible for servicing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given device configuration, when route is assigned, then device becomes part of route's device list
- Given route assignment change, when saved, then change is reflected in route planning and service order systems
- Given route deletion, when route has assigned devices, then device route assignments are cleared (SET NULL)
- Given device with active service orders, when route reassignment is attempted, then business rules are validated

**Priority**: P1 (Operational efficiency)
**Dependencies**: Routes table, service order system
**Technical Constraints**: Route assignments must consider active service orders
**UX Considerations**: Drag-and-drop route assignment interface, bulk assignment capabilities

### F6: Device Search and Filtering
**User Story**: As an operations user, I want to quickly find specific devices using various search criteria, so that I can efficiently locate and manage devices in large fleets.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given search criteria (asset ID, cooler number, location name), when search is performed, then matching devices are returned in relevance order
- Given filter options (device type, location, route), when applied, then device list is filtered accordingly
- Given search/filter combination, when applied, then results are paginated for performance
- Given no search results, when query returns empty, then helpful message suggests alternative search terms

**Priority**: P1 (User experience requirement)
**Dependencies**: Database indexing on searchable fields
**Technical Constraints**: Search must perform well with 10,000+ devices
**UX Considerations**: Real-time search suggestions, clear filter interface
