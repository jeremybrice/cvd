## Feature Specifications

### F1: Drag-and-Drop Planogram Interface
**User Story**: As an operations manager, I want to intuitively arrange products in cabinet slots using drag-and-drop functionality, so that I can quickly configure optimal product placements without complex forms.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given product catalog and empty cabinet grid, when I drag product to slot, then product is placed and slot is updated in real-time
- Given occupied slot, when I drag different product to same slot, then previous product is replaced and change is immediately saved
- Given product in slot, when I drag to different slot, then product moves and original slot becomes empty
- Given invalid placement (empty slot), when I attempt to drag product, then visual feedback indicates invalid target and no change occurs

**Priority**: P0 (Core user experience requirement)
**Dependencies**: Product catalog, cabinet configurations, real-time database updates
**Technical Constraints**: Must work across different browser types, responsive for tablet use
**UX Considerations**: Visual drag feedback, slot highlighting, clear product identification

### F2: AI-Powered Optimization
**User Story**: As a business analyst, I want AI recommendations for optimal product placement based on sales data and performance metrics, so that I can maximize revenue and improve inventory turnover.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given sales history and current planogram, when AI optimization is requested, then system analyzes performance and suggests improvements
- Given optimization suggestions, when presented to user, then recommendations include reasoning (high-performing products, sales velocity, complementary items)
- Given AI recommendations, when user accepts suggestions, then planogram is updated with optimized product placement
- Given insufficient data for optimization, when requested, then system provides helpful message explaining data requirements

**Priority**: P1 (Value-added feature)
**Dependencies**: Sales data analysis, Anthropic Claude API, planogram optimizer module
**Technical Constraints**: Requires external AI API, graceful fallback if API unavailable
**UX Considerations**: Clear presentation of recommendations, easy accept/reject interface

### F3: Product Catalog Integration
**User Story**: As an operations user, I want access to a comprehensive product catalog with categories and pricing, so that I can make informed decisions about product placement and inventory management.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given product catalog, when I view products, then I see product name, category, price, and image (if available)
- Given product search, when I enter search criteria, then relevant products are filtered and displayed
- Given product categories, when I select category, then only products in that category are shown
- Given product selection, when I drag to planogram slot, then product information is stored with correct product ID and name

**Priority**: P0 (Core functionality requirement)
**Dependencies**: Products table with complete product information
**Technical Constraints**: Must handle large product catalogs efficiently
**UX Considerations**: Quick product search, clear product information display, category filtering

### F4: Real-Time Database Operations
**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want planogram changes to be immediately saved to the database without caching layers, so that all users see consistent data and no changes are lost.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given planogram change, when slot is updated, then change is immediately written to database without caching
- Given concurrent users editing same planogram, when changes occur, then conflicts are detected and resolved appropriately
- Given database write failure, when planogram update fails, then user receives clear error message and can retry operation
- Given planogram view refresh, when page is reloaded, then current database state is always displayed

**Priority**: P0 (Data integrity requirement)
**Dependencies**: Direct database connection, transaction management
**Technical Constraints**: Must maintain performance without caching while ensuring data consistency
**UX Considerations**: Immediate visual feedback, error handling with retry options

### F5: Inventory Level Management
**User Story**: As a route planner, I want to set and track current quantities and par levels for each product slot, so that I can generate accurate restocking requirements and maintain optimal inventory levels.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given product in planogram slot, when I set current quantity, then value is validated against capacity and saved
- Given product slot, when I set par level, then value is validated as reasonable percentage of capacity
- Given quantity below par level, when viewed, then slot is visually indicated as needing restocking
- Given bulk quantity update, when applied to multiple slots, then all changes are processed atomically

**Priority**: P0 (Operational requirement)
**Dependencies**: Planogram slots table with quantity and par level fields
**Technical Constraints**: Quantity validation must prevent negative values or values exceeding capacity
**UX Considerations**: Quick quantity entry, visual indicators for low stock, bulk update capabilities

### F6: Cabinet-Specific Planogram Management
**User Story**: As a device technician, I want to manage separate planograms for each cabinet within a multi-cabinet device, so that I can optimize product mix for different cabinet types and customer preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given multi-cabinet device, when I select cabinet, then correct planogram for that cabinet is displayed
- Given cabinet switch, when I change to different cabinet, then planogram context changes and previous cabinet planogram is saved
- Given cabinet configuration changes, when cabinet dimensions are modified, then planogram is validated and adjusted if necessary
- Given cabinet deletion, when cabinet is removed from device, then associated planogram data is handled according to cascade rules

**Priority**: P0 (Multi-cabinet support requirement)
**Dependencies**: Cabinet configurations, device management system
**Technical Constraints**: Planogram data must be isolated by cabinet, efficient cabinet switching
**UX Considerations**: Clear cabinet identification, seamless switching between cabinets

## Functional Requirements

### Planogram Data Management

   - Generate grid based on cabinet dimensions (rows × columns)
   - Create planogram slots with unique position identifiers
   - Initialize slots with default values (empty, zero quantities)
   - Generate unique planogram key for cabinet identification

2. **Product Assignment Process**:
   - Validate product exists in catalog
   - Assign product to specific slot position
   - Set initial quantity and capacity values
   - Update slot with product information and pricing
   - Save changes directly to database

3. **Inventory Management Process**:
   - Track current quantity vs capacity for each slot
   - Monitor par levels and generate low stock indicators
   - Calculate units needed to reach par levels
   - Support bulk quantity updates across slots

4. **Optimization Process**:
   - Analyze sales data for product performance
   - Generate AI-powered placement recommendations
   - Present optimization suggestions with reasoning
   - Apply accepted optimizations to planogram
