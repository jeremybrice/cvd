## Feature Specifications

### F1: Cabinet-Centric Service Order Creation
**User Story**: As a route manager, I want to create service orders by selecting specific cabinets across multiple devices, so that drivers receive precise instructions about which cabinets need service and what products are required.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given device list with cabinet information, when I select specific cabinets, then service order preview shows selected cabinets with product requirements
- Given cabinet selection, when par levels are below current quantities, then cabinet appears in products-needed calculation
- Given multiple cabinets selected, when service order is created, then pick list is aggregated across all selected cabinets
- Given service order creation, when saved, then order is assigned to route driver and status is set to 'pending'

**Priority**: P0 (Core operational requirement)
**Dependencies**: Device and cabinet management, planogram data with par levels
**Technical Constraints**: Must handle complex cabinet selection scenarios efficiently
**UX Considerations**: Visual cabinet selection interface, clear indication of service requirements

### F2: Intelligent Pick List Generation
**User Story**: As a route driver, I want an aggregated pick list that combines all products needed across my assigned cabinets, so that I can efficiently load my truck with the right inventory quantities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given selected cabinets with product shortfalls, when pick list is generated, then products are aggregated by product ID across all cabinets
- Given aggregated products, when pick list is displayed, then products are sorted by category and name for efficient picking
- Given pick list calculation, when par levels exceed current quantities, then difference is calculated and included in pick list
- Given empty slots (product_id = 1), when calculating pick list, then empty slots are excluded from requirements

**Priority**: P0 (Operational efficiency requirement)
**Dependencies**: Planogram data with accurate quantities and par levels
**Technical Constraints**: Must calculate aggregations efficiently for large service orders
**UX Considerations**: Clear pick list format, product categorization for easy navigation

### F3: Service Order Workflow States
**User Story**: As an operations manager, I want to track service orders through their lifecycle states, so that I can monitor progress and ensure all orders are completed appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given new service order, when created, then status is automatically set to 'pending'
- Given pending order, when driver begins service, then status changes to 'in_progress' and started_at timestamp is recorded
- Given order with some cabinets serviced, when work begins, then order status remains 'in_progress' until all cabinets are completed
- Given all cabinets completed, when final cabinet is serviced, then order status changes to 'completed' and completed_at timestamp is recorded

**Priority**: P0 (Workflow management requirement)
**Dependencies**: Service order state management, cabinet execution tracking
**Technical Constraints**: State transitions must be atomic and properly synchronized
**UX Considerations**: Clear status indicators, progress tracking for multi-cabinet orders

### F4: Mobile Photo Verification
**User Story**: As a field driver, I want to take photos during service completion to document the work performed, so that there is visual proof of service quality and inventory levels.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given service order execution, when cabinet service is completed, then driver can capture photos using mobile camera
- Given photo capture, when image is taken, then photo is associated with specific cabinet service and uploaded to server
- Given photo upload, when image is processed, then photo metadata (timestamp, location if available) is stored with image
- Given completed service, when photos are uploaded, then service completion can proceed with photo verification

**Priority**: P1 (Quality assurance feature)
**Dependencies**: Mobile PWA camera access, file upload infrastructure
**Technical Constraints**: Must work across different mobile devices and browsers
**UX Considerations**: Easy camera access, clear photo association with specific cabinets

### F5: Real-Time Inventory Updates
**User Story**: As a service technician, I want to update actual quantities delivered during service, so that planogram inventory levels accurately reflect the current state of each cabinet.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given service execution, when I deliver products to slots, then I can record actual quantities filled for each product
- Given quantity filled entry, when saved, then planogram slot quantities are updated in real-time
- Given partial deliveries, when some products are not available, then I can record partial quantities and remaining shortfall
- Given service completion, when all deliveries are recorded, then planogram reflects accurate current inventory levels

**Priority**: P0 (Inventory accuracy requirement)
**Dependencies**: Planogram slots table, service visit items tracking
**Technical Constraints**: Must maintain data consistency between service records and planogram state
**UX Considerations**: Quick quantity entry interface, clear indication of delivered vs planned quantities

### F6: Service Order Preview and Estimation
**User Story**: As a route planner, I want to preview service order contents and time estimates before creation, so that I can optimize driver schedules and ensure adequate resource allocation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given cabinet selections, when preview is requested, then system shows estimated service time and total units to be loaded
- Given service order preview, when displayed, then pick list shows aggregated products with quantities needed
- Given device summary, when shown, then devices are grouped with cabinet counts and locations for route optimization
- Given time estimation, when calculated, then system uses 10 minutes per cabinet as base estimation with unit count considerations

**Priority**: P1 (Planning optimization feature)
**Dependencies**: Cabinet selection interface, pick list calculation logic
**Technical Constraints**: Preview calculations must be fast and accurate
**UX Considerations**: Clear preview layout, easy transition from preview to order creation

## Functional Requirements

### Service Order Lifecycle Management
1. **Creation Process**:
   - Select cabinets across multiple devices
   - Calculate aggregated pick list from par level shortfalls
   - Estimate service time and total units
   - Assign to route driver automatically
   - Set initial status to 'pending'

2. **Execution Process**:
   - Driver accesses assigned orders on mobile device
   - Update status to 'in_progress' when service begins
   - Execute service on individual cabinets
   - Record actual quantities delivered per product
   - Capture verification photos for quality assurance
   - Update planogram inventory levels in real-time

3. **Completion Process**:
   - Mark individual cabinets as completed
   - Automatically detect when all cabinets are serviced
   - Update order status to 'completed'
   - Record completion timestamp and final metrics
   - Synchronize all data to central system

### State Management
- Service Order States: pending → in_progress → completed (or cancelled)
- Cabinet Service States: pending → executed (tracked per cabinet)
- Inventory State: synchronized with planogram slots in real-time
- Photo Documentation: linked to specific cabinet services

### Business Logic Rules
- Empty slots (product_id = 1) excluded from pick list calculations
- Par level must exceed current quantity to generate requirement
- Service orders cannot be deleted once execution begins
- Drivers can only access their assigned route orders
- Cabinet execution updates both service records and planogram data

- Device and cabinet management system
- Planogram inventory tracking
- Route and driver management
- Mobile PWA for field execution
- Photo storage and management system
