## Feature Specifications

### F1: User Login Authentication
**User Story**: As a system user, I want to securely log into the CVD system with my credentials, so that I can access features appropriate to my role and responsibility level.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given valid username and password credentials, when I submit login form, then I am authenticated and redirected to appropriate dashboard
- Given invalid credentials, when I attempt login, then I receive clear error message and login attempt is logged
- Given multiple failed attempts, when threshold is exceeded, then account is temporarily locked and administrator is notified
- Given successful authentication, when session is created, then device type is detected and logged for security monitoring

**Priority**: P0 (Critical system requirement)
**Dependencies**: Database user table, session management system
**Technical Constraints**: Must support both web browsers and mobile PWA clients
**UX Considerations**: Simple, mobile-friendly login form with clear error messaging

### F2: Session Management
**User Story**: As an authenticated user, I want my session to remain active during normal usage but expire when appropriate, so that my account remains secure while allowing productive work.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given active user session, when 8 hours pass without activity, then session expires automatically
- Given user closes browser, when they return within session lifetime, then they remain authenticated
- Given user explicitly logs out, when logout is processed, then session is immediately invalidated
- Given session expires, when user attempts protected action, then they are redirected to login with appropriate message

**Priority**: P0 (Security requirement)
**Dependencies**: Session table, authentication middleware
**Technical Constraints**: Must work across multiple browser tabs and mobile app instances
**UX Considerations**: Warning before session expiration, seamless re-authentication flow

### F3: Role-Based Access Control
**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want users to access only features appropriate to their role, so that data security is maintained and users have appropriate operational capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user role assignment, when accessing protected resource, then permissions are validated against role matrix
- Given insufficient permissions, when unauthorized access is attempted, then user receives 403 error and attempt is audited
- Given role change by administrator, when user's next request is processed, then new permissions take effect immediately
- Given deleted/deactivated user account, when any access is attempted, then all sessions are invalidated

**Priority**: P0 (Security and compliance requirement)
**Dependencies**: User roles definition, permissions matrix, audit logging system
**Technical Constraints**: Real-time permission validation without performance degradation
**UX Considerations**: Clear messaging about insufficient permissions, appropriate feature hiding/disabling

### F4: Device Type Detection
**User Story**: As a security administrator, I want to track device types used for authentication, so that I can identify potential security threats and optimize user experience by device.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user agent string during login, when session is created, then device type is classified (mobile, tablet, desktop, bot)
- Given mobile device detection, when user accesses system, then mobile-optimized interfaces are prioritized
- Given bot/crawler detection, when access is attempted, then appropriate security measures are applied
- Given unusual device type patterns, when detected for user, then security alerts may be generated

**Priority**: P1 (Security enhancement)
**Dependencies**: User agent parsing logic, security monitoring system
**Technical Constraints**: Must handle diverse user agent strings accurately
**UX Considerations**: Transparent to users, enhances rather than complicates experience

### F5: Password Security
**User Story**: As a user, I want my password to be securely stored and validated, so that my account cannot be compromised even if data is breached.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given password during registration/change, when stored, then password is hashed using secure algorithm (werkzeug.security)
- Given password during login, when validated, then hash comparison is performed securely
- Given password change request, when processed, then old password must be verified before new password is set
- Given password requirements, when new password is created, then complexity rules are enforced and validated

**Priority**: P0 (Security requirement)
**Dependencies**: Password hashing library, validation rules
**Technical Constraints**: Must be cryptographically secure and performant
**UX Considerations**: Clear password requirements, strength indicators

### F6: Audit Logging
**User Story**: As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive logs of authentication events, so that I can meet regulatory requirements and investigate security incidents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given authentication attempt, when processed, then event is logged with timestamp, IP address, user agent, and result
- Given role change or permission modification, when executed, then detailed audit entry is created
- Given unauthorized access attempt, when detected, then security event is logged with contextual information
- Given audit log query, when requested by authorized user, then relevant entries are retrievable with search/filter capabilities

**Priority**: P0 (Compliance requirement)
**Dependencies**: Audit log table, security monitoring system
**Technical Constraints**: High-performance logging that doesn't impact authentication speed
**UX Considerations**: Admin interface for audit log viewing and searching

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication Flow
1. **User Login Process**:
   - User submits credentials via login form
   - System validates credentials against user database
   - Device type is detected from user agent
   - If valid, session is created with 8-hour expiration
   - User is redirected to role-appropriate dashboard
   - All login attempts are logged

2. **Session Validation**:
   - Every protected request validates session ID
   - Session expiration is checked against current time
   - User role is verified for requested resource
   - Failed validations redirect to login

3. **Logout Process**:
   - User session is invalidated in database
   - Session cookie is cleared
   - User is redirected to login page
   - Logout event is logged

### State Management
- Sessions stored in database with expiration tracking
- User context maintained in Flask's 'g' object during request
- Role permissions cached during request for performance
- Concurrent session handling across multiple devices

### Data Validation Rules
- Username: Required, alphanumeric, 3-50 characters
- Password: Minimum complexity requirements enforced
- Session ID: Cryptographically secure random token
- IP address validation and tracking
- User agent string sanitization

### Integration Points
- Database user and session tables
- Audit logging system
- Security monitoring system
- Frontend authentication state management

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Authentication response time: <2 seconds (95th percentile)
- Session validation time: <100ms (99th percentile)
- Password hash generation: <500ms
- Audit log write time: <50ms (async preferred)

### Scalability Needs
- Support 1000+ concurrent authenticated users
- Handle 10,000+ authentication requests per hour
- Session storage scalable across multiple instances
- Audit log storage with retention policies

### Security Requirements
- Password hashing using werkzeug.security (PBKDF2 with SHA256)

- Protection against brute force attacks
- Session fixation protection
- CSRF protection for authentication endpoints

### Accessibility Standards

- Mobile accessibility for PWA users

## User Experience Requirements

### Information Architecture
- Clear login/logout states
- Role-appropriate navigation menus
- Permission-based feature visibility
- Consistent authentication feedback

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy
- Basic login form for initial access
- Advanced options (password reset) available but not prominent
- Role-based feature revelation after authentication
- Security information on-demand

### Error Prevention Mechanisms
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Clear password requirements display
- Account lockout prevention with warning
- Session expiration warnings

### Feedback Patterns
- Immediate feedback on login attempts
- Clear error messages for failed authentication
- Success confirmation for security actions
- Progress indicators for slower authentication steps
