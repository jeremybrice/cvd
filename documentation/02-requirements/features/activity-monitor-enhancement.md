- **Type**: Requirements
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-13
- **Status**: Draft
- **Priority**: P1
- **Tags**: #activity-monitor #analytics #visualization #ui-enhancement #user-experience

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch

Replace the Activity History section with a daily trends graph and move user search to a modal for better screen utilization.

### Problem Statement

The Activity History search section at the bottom of the Activity Monitor page consumes valuable screen real estate while being used infrequently, limiting the visibility of more important real-time monitoring data.

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: System Administrators (monitoring system health and user activity)
- **Secondary**: Managers (reviewing team activity patterns and system usage)
- **Demographics**: Technical staff aged 25-55, familiar with dashboard analytics

### Unique Selling Proposition

Provides instant visual insights into daily activity patterns while maintaining detailed user search capabilities in a space-efficient modal interface.

### Success Metrics

- **Engagement Rate**: 80% of admins interact with trends graph weekly
- **Time to Insight**: 50% reduction in time to identify activity patterns
- **Screen Utilization**: 35% more data visible without scrolling
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5/5 rating for improved interface
- **Search Usage**: No decrease in user history search frequency

## Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: Daily Activity Trends Graph

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want to see daily activity trends at a glance, so that I can quickly identify usage patterns and anomalies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Given the Activity Monitor page is loaded, when I view the bottom section, then I see a trends graph instead of the search box
- Given the trends graph is displayed, when I view it, then I see the last 30 days of activity data by default
- Given multiple metrics are available, when I interact with the graph, then I can toggle between different metrics
- Edge case: When no data exists for a date range, display a clear "No data available" message

**Priority**: P0 (Critical path feature)

**Dependencies**:

- Chart.js library integration (or similar)
- API endpoint for fetching daily summaries
- activity_summary_daily table populated with data

**Technical Constraints**:

- Must load within 2 seconds
- Must be responsive on screens >= 768px wide
- Must support color-blind accessible color schemes

**UX Considerations**:

- Interactive tooltips showing exact values on hover
- Legend clearly identifying each metric line
- Date range selector for custom periods
- Export functionality for data

### Feature 2: User History Modal

**User Story**: As an administrator, I want to search for specific user activity history without leaving the main dashboard, so that I can maintain context while investigating.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Given the Activity Monitor page is loaded, when I click the "User History" button, then a modal dialog opens
- Given the modal is open, when I enter a username and click search, then the user's activity timeline loads within the modal
- Given search results are displayed, when I click outside the modal or the close button, then the modal closes
- Edge case: When searching for a non-existent user, display appropriate error message

**Priority**: P0 (Required for feature parity)

**Dependencies**:

- Modal component implementation
- Existing user history API endpoints
- User search functionality

**Technical Constraints**:

- Modal must be keyboard accessible (ESC to close)
- Must maintain scroll position of main page when modal opens
- Must support pagination for long activity histories

**UX Considerations**:

- Modal should cover 80% of viewport on desktop, 95% on mobile
- Include loading states during search
- Maintain search history for session
- Clear call-to-action buttons

### Feature 3: Enhanced Trends Visualization

**User Story**: As a manager, I want to compare different metrics on the same graph, so that I can understand correlations between user activity patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Given the trends graph is displayed, when I select multiple metrics, then they display as separate lines on the same chart
- Given multiple metrics are shown, when I hover over a data point, then I see all metric values for that date
- Given the graph has data, when I click a data point, then I can drill down to that day's detailed activity
- Edge case: When selecting conflicting scale metrics, use dual Y-axis display

**Priority**: P1 (Enhancement)

**Dependencies**:

- Multi-series chart support
- Daily detail view implementation

**Technical Constraints**:

- Maximum 4 metrics simultaneously displayed
- Must maintain performance with 365 days of data
- Chart must be printable

**UX Considerations**:

- Distinct line styles for accessibility
- Metric selector with preview icons
- Smooth transitions when toggling metrics
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions

## Requirements Documentation Structure

### 1. Functional Requirements

#### User Flows

#### Primary Flow: View Activity Trends

1. Admin navigates to Activity Monitor page
2. System loads current active sessions in top section
3. System loads and displays 30-day activity trends graph at bottom
4. Admin interacts with graph controls:
   - Toggle metrics on/off
   - Change date range
   - Hover for details
5. Admin gains insights from visual patterns

#### Secondary Flow: Search User History

1. Admin clicks "User History" button
2. Modal dialog opens with search interface
3. Admin enters username
4. System searches and displays activity timeline
5. Admin reviews activity details
6. Admin closes modal to return to main view

#### State Management Needs

- **Graph State**: Selected metrics, date range, zoom level
- **Modal State**: Open/closed, search query, results, pagination
- **Cache State**: Daily summary data for performance
- **Session State**: User preferences for metric selection

#### Data Validation Rules

- Date ranges limited to available data (max 365 days)
- Username search requires minimum 2 characters
- Export limited to 10,000 records per request
- Metric combinations validated for scale compatibility

#### Integration Points

- `/api/admin/activity/trends` - New endpoint for daily summaries
- `/api/admin/activity/history/{user_id}` - Existing user history endpoint
- `/api/admin/activity/export` - New endpoint for data export
- Chart.js or D3.js for visualization

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Targets

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds for page with 30 days of data
- **Graph Update**: < 500ms for metric toggle
- **Modal Open**: < 300ms animation
- **Search Results**: < 1 second for user history
- **Export Generation**: < 5 seconds for 365 days of data

#### Scalability Needs

- Support 1000 concurrent admin users
- Handle 365 days × 6 metrics of data points
- Cache daily summaries for 24 hours
- Pagination for > 100 activity records

#### Security Requirements

- Admin role required for all features
