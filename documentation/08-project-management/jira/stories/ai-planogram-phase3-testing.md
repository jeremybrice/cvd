# AI Planogram Enhancement - Phase 3 & Testing Stories

## Phase 3 Stories (Weeks 7-12) - Scale & Optimization

### Story 10: Location-Based Personalization

**Story Title**  
Implement Location-Specific AI Planogram Recommendations

---

**Background / Context**

Different locations have vastly different customer demographics and purchasing patterns. A planogram that works well in an office building performs poorly at a gym or school. Currently, merchandisers use the same template across all locations, missing opportunities to optimize for local preferences. Location-based AI personalization can increase revenue by 15-25% by tailoring product mix to specific venues.

---

  - Peak hours heat map
  - Top performing products at similar locations
  - Demographic insights
* Add "Optimize for Location" button
* Show personalization suggestions with reasoning:
  - "Gyms sell 3x more protein bars"
  - "Morning coffee sales peak at 7-9 AM here"
* Display confidence score for recommendations
* Allow manual override of venue type

**System Logic**
* Classify locations using:
  - Historical sales patterns
  - Time-of-day distributions
  - Product category mix performance
  - Seasonal variations
* Cluster similar locations using ML

    - Stockouts prevented: X
  - Show optimized route on map with numbered stops
  - Color code stops by priority (red=urgent, yellow=soon, green=ok)
  - Display predicted service needs at each stop
* Add "Compare Routes" view showing current vs optimized
* Include driver mobile app updates for real-time routing

**System Logic**
* Integrate with demand forecasting to predict service needs
* Consider factors:
  - Current stock levels from telemetry
  - Predicted demand for next 48 hours
  - Traffic patterns and drive times
  - Driver capacity and skills
  - Service window requirements
  - Machine priority levels
