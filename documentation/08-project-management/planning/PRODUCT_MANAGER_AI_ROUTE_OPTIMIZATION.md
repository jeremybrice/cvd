# AI-Powered Route Optimization Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
An intelligent system that automatically arranges delivery routes to minimize travel time and maximize driver efficiency for vending machine maintenance visits.

### Problem Statement
Current route planning is manual and static, resulting in inefficient travel patterns, increased fuel costs, delayed service to critical machines, and driver fatigue from unnecessarily long routes. Route planners lack real-time visibility into traffic conditions and cannot dynamically adjust routes based on changing priorities or device conditions.

### Target Audience

  - Goals: Complete routes efficiently, minimize overtime
  
- **Fleet Managers** (Ages 35-60): Executives overseeing entire operation
  - Experience: 5+ years management
  - Goals: Reduce costs, improve service metrics

### Unique Selling Proposition
Unlike static route planners, this system continuously optimizes routes using AI that considers real-time traffic, device fill levels, service windows, and historical patterns to reduce travel time by 25-40% while ensuring critical machines never run empty.

### Success Metrics
