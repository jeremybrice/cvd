## Navigation Guide

### For New Team Members
1. Start with `01-project-core/` to understand the project
2. Review `02-requirements/` for functional understanding
3. Check `03-architecture/` for technical overview
4. Use `09-reference/quick-start.md` for rapid onboarding

### For Developers
1. Begin with `05-development/developer-setup.md`
2. Reference `05-development/api/` for API documentation
3. Check `04-implementation/` for coding guides
4. Use `09-reference/cheat-sheets/` for quick lookups

### For Architects
1. Focus on `03-architecture/` for design decisions
2. Review `07-cvd-framework/` for domain architecture

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-name.md`
- ADRs numbered sequentially: `ADR-001-decision-title.md`
- Date-stamped logs: `2024-01-15-sprint-review.md`

### Content Structure
- Each document starts with purpose/overview
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Add navigation hints where helpful

### Cross-References
- Use relative links between documents
- Maintain index files in `00-index/`
- Update master index when adding documents

## Quick Links

- [Master Index](00-index/master-index.md) - Complete documentation catalog
- [Quick Start Guide](09-reference/quick-start.md) - Rapid onboarding
- [API Reference](05-development/api/api-reference.md) - Complete API docs
- [Architecture Overview](03-architecture/architecture-overview.md) - System design
- [Project Plan](08-project-management/project-plan.md) - Timeline and milestones

## Maintenance

This documentation system should be maintained alongside code development:
- Update documentation with each feature
- Review and update quarterly
- Archive outdated documents
- Maintain cross-references

## Contributing

When adding documentation:
1. Place in appropriate category
2. Follow naming conventions
3. Update relevant index files
4. Add cross-references as needed
5. Include in master index
