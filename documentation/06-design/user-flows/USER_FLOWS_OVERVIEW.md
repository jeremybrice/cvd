## Cross-Flow Patterns

### Navigation Patterns

#### Breadcrumb Navigation
Used consistently across desktop flows to show location and enable quick navigation.

```
Home > Devices > Device Configuration > Cabinet Setup
```

**Implementation**:
- Always clickable except current page
- Shows full path for deep workflows
- Collapses intelligently on mobile
- ARIA navigation role for accessibility

#### Contextual Actions
Actions change based on current context and user permissions.

**Device List Context**:
- Bulk actions: Delete selected, Export data
- Individual actions: Edit, View details, Duplicate
- Create actions: Add new device, Import devices

**Service Order Context**:
- Order actions: Edit, Cancel, Duplicate
- Execution actions: Start route, Mark complete
- Management actions: Reassign, Change priority

### State Management Patterns

#### Loading States
Consistent loading patterns across all workflows:

**Initial Load**: Skeleton screens for predictable layouts
**Action Feedback**: Inline spinners for button actions
**Background Sync**: Subtle indicators for ongoing operations
**Offline Mode**: Clear indicators and cached content

#### Empty States
Encouraging and helpful empty states guide users toward value:

**First Use**: Onboarding guidance and sample data
**No Results**: Search suggestions and filter adjustments
**Temporary Empty**: "Coming soon" with expected timelines
**Error Empty**: Recovery actions and support information

### Data Entry Patterns

#### Form Progression
Complex forms use consistent progression patterns:

**Linear Flows**: Step-by-step with clear progress indication
**Hub-and-Spoke**: Central overview with detail sections
**Wizard Flows**: Guided process with validation gates
**Free-form**: Flexible entry with smart suggestions

#### Validation Timing
- **On blur**: For individual field validation
- **On submit**: For form-wide validation
- **Real-time**: For availability checks and complex rules
- **Batch**: For bulk operations with summary

### Notification Patterns

#### System Notifications
Consistent hierarchy for different message types:

**Critical**: Modal dialogs requiring immediate action
**Important**: Toast notifications with action buttons
**Informational**: Subtle badges and indicators
**Success**: Brief confirmations with auto-dismiss

#### User-Generated Notifications
Users can control notification preferences:

**Email Notifications**: Digest format for non-urgent updates
**Push Notifications**: Urgent alerts and assignment updates
**In-App Notifications**: Activity feed and task updates
**SMS Notifications**: Critical alerts only
