## 1. Current System Assessment

### 1.1 Existing Planogram Management Capabilities

**Strengths:**
- **AI-Powered Optimization**: Claude API integration for intelligent product placement recommendations
- **Empty Slot Prioritization**: System correctly identifies and prioritizes $0 revenue slots
- **Multi-Cabinet Support**: Handles up to 3 cabinets per device with independent planograms
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: User-friendly planogram builder (NSPT.html)
- **Product Catalog**: 32 products across multiple categories (beverages, snacks, candy)
- **Slot-Level Management**: Granular control over capacity, par levels, and pricing

**Weaknesses:**
- **Limited Performance Metrics**: Only basic velocity and revenue calculations
- **No Real-Time Updates**: Planogram changes don't trigger immediate analytics refresh
- **Missing A/B Testing**: No capability to test multiple planogram variants
- **Lack of Seasonality Handling**: No temporal pattern recognition
- **No Category Optimization**: Basic category distribution without strategic placement rules

### 1.2 Available Data Sources

**Currently Utilized:**
- **Sales Data** (2,731 records): Transaction-level data with product, units, and revenue
- **Planogram Configuration** (1,658 slots): Current product placement across fleet
- **DEX Data** (603 PA records): Detailed vending audit data with grid patterns
- **Device Metrics**: Basic KPIs (sold-out count, days remaining inventory)
- **Service Orders**: Restocking requirements and fulfillment history

**Underutilized:**
- **DEX Grid Patterns**: 5 pattern types detected but not used for optimization
- **Location Data**: Geographic coordinates available but not factored into recommendations
- **Route Information**: Service frequency not integrated with velocity calculations
- **Historical Planograms**: No tracking of planogram evolution or performance

### 1.3 Current Optimization Methods

The `PlanogramOptimizer` class provides:
- **30-Day Sales Analysis**: Historical performance window
- **Position-Based Recommendations**: Eye-level (Row A) premium placement logic
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 scale for recommendation reliability
- **Category Gap Detection**: Identifies missing product categories
- **Stockout Risk Assessment**: High/Medium/Low risk categorization

**Critical Limitations:**
- Single-point optimization (no continuous improvement loop)
- No cross-device learning or fleet-wide patterns
- Limited to Claude API availability (no fallback optimization)
- No consideration of complementary product placement
- Missing profitability analysis (margin contribution)
