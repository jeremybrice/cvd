# Requirements Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary
Analysis comparing the Product Manager Execution Plan against Phase 1 Requirements Engineering reveals critical gaps in technical implementation details, data specifications, and system integration requirements.

## Top 5 Critical Gaps

### 1. **Data Model & Database Schema Specifications**
**Gap:** The execution plan mentions "data model requirements" but lacks concrete schema definitions, relationship mappings, and PostgreSQL-specific configurations.
**Missing Details:**
- Complete ERD with all entity relationships
- PostgreSQL-specific data types and indexing strategies
- Migration mapping from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Database partitioning and optimization strategies
- Specific field constraints and validation rules

### 2. **API Contract Implementation Details**
**Gap:** While API endpoints are listed, the execution plan lacks request/response schemas, error handling specifications, and authentication flow details.
**Missing Details:**
- Complete OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- JWT token structure and refresh mechanism
- Rate limiting implementation specs
- API versioning strategy
- Webhook specifications for real-time updates

### 3. **PWA Technical Architecture**
**Gap:** PWA requirements mention features but lack technical implementation specifics for offline sync, conflict resolution, and service worker strategies.
**Missing Details:**
- IndexedDB schema and sync queue structure
- Conflict resolution algorithms for offline edits
- Service worker caching strategies
- Background sync implementation details
- Push notification payload structures

### 4. **Integration Specifications**
**Gap:** Third-party integrations are mentioned without technical implementation details, authentication methods, or fallback strategies.
**Missing Details:**
- Google Maps API integration patterns
- SendGrid/AWS SES email template specifications
- Twilio SMS workflow definitions
- S3 bucket structure and naming conventions
- Integration error handling and retry mechanisms

### 5. **Performance & Scalability Implementation**
**Gap:** Performance targets are defined but lack implementation strategies for achieving them.
**Missing Details:**
- Redis caching key patterns and TTL strategies
- Celery task queue configuration specs
- Database connection pooling parameters
- Load balancing configuration requirements
- CDN implementation for static assets

## Additional Notable Gaps
- Security implementation details (JWT secret rotation, CORS configuration)
- Testing framework specifications and CI/CD requirements
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure requirements
- Deployment architecture and containerization specs

## Recommendations
These gaps require immediate attention in the execution plan to ensure Phase 2 (System Architecture) has sufficient technical detail for implementation.
