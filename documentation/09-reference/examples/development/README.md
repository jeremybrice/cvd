# Development Resources and AI Prompts

## Purpose
Development guides, AI prompts, and resources used for working with Claude Code and managing development processes.

## Contents

### AI Assistant Prompts
- **claude-code-expert-agent-prompt.md** - Specialized Claude Code prompt for CVD development
- **claude-code-expert-agent-prompt-general.md** - General-purpose Claude Code development prompt

### Product Management Resources
- **product-manager-execution-plan.md** - Product management execution framework
- **product-manager-enhanced-execution-plan.md** - Enhanced product management strategies

## Usage

These resources are used for:
1. **AI-Assisted Development** - Optimizing Claude Code interactions for CVD development
2. **Product Management** - Structuring product management workflows
3. **Development Process** - Standardizing development approaches and methodologies
4. **Knowledge Transfer** - Documenting effective development practices

## Document Types

### AI Prompts
Specialized prompts designed to:
- Configure Claude Code for CVD-specific development
- Establish context about the CVD system architecture
- Define coding standards and practices
- Set expectations for code quality and documentation

### Execution Plans
Comprehensive plans including:
- Product development workflows
- Feature prioritization frameworks
- Implementation strategies
- Quality assurance processes
- Stakeholder communication plans

## File Locations
Files migrated from `/docs/examples/` to this directory:
- `claude-code-expert-agent-prompt.md`
- `claude-code-expert-agent-prompt-general.md`
- `product-manager-execution-plan.md`
- `product-manager-enhanced-execution-plan.md`

## Integration with Current Documentation
These resources complement:
- **[AI Assistant Guide](/documentation/01-project-core/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md)** - Current AI assistance documentation
- **[Development Setup](/documentation/05-development/SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Development environment setup
- **[Coding Standards](/documentation/05-development/CODING_STANDARDS.md)** - Current coding standards

## Best Practices
- Use AI prompts as starting points, customize for specific tasks
- Review execution plans regularly and update based on project evolution
- Integrate these resources with existing development workflows
- Share learnings and improvements back to the documentation
