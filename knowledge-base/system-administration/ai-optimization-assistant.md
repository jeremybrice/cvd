2. **Select Device**: Choose your target vending machine from the device dropdown
3. **Choose Cabinet**: Select the specific cabinet to optimize
4. **Click AI Assistant Button**: Look for the AI Assistant button in the toolbar (brain icon with "AI Assistant" text)

The AI panel will appear as a floating interface on the right side of the screen.

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Score Display

The central feature is a circular score indicator showing your planogram's overall optimization score:

- **Score Range**: 0-100 (higher is better)
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green (80-100): Excellent optimization
  - Yellow (60-79): Good performance
  - Orange (40-59): Fair, room for improvement
  - Red (0-39): Poor, needs significant changes

### Component Scores

Three sub-scores break down the overall optimization:

1. **Zone Score**: How well products are positioned in optimal visibility zones
2. **Affinity Score**: Product relationships and complementary placement
3. **Category Score**: Balance and distribution of product categories

### Real-time Feedback

The assistant provides immediate feedback when you make changes:

- **Live Score Updates**: Scores update as you drag products
- **Instant Suggestions**: Recommendations appear for each change
- **Performance Impact**: See how changes affect overall optimization

## How the Optimization Works

### Data Analysis Process

The AI assistant follows a comprehensive analysis workflow:

#### 1. Sales Data Collection
```
- Gathers 30 days of transaction history
- Analyzes units sold per product
- Calculates daily revenue per item
- Identifies sales velocity patterns
```

#### 2. Performance Metrics Calculation
```
- Product velocity (units per day)
- Revenue performance by slot position
- Category distribution analysis
- Stockout risk assessment
- Empty slot identification
```

#### 3. Zone Analysis
```
- Eye-level positioning (Row A = premium)
- Accessibility scoring by position
- Traffic pattern considerations
- Visual prominence evaluation
```

#### 4. AI Recommendation Generation
The system builds a comprehensive prompt for Claude AI including:
- Current planogram configuration
- Sales performance metrics
- Empty slot locations
- Top-performing products
- Category gaps

### Optimization Algorithm

The AI uses multiple factors to generate recommendations:

1. **Empty Slot Priority**: Fills revenue-generating gaps first
2. **High-Performance Placement**: Places top sellers in premium positions
3. **Category Balance**: Ensures diverse product mix
4. **Complementary Products**: Groups related items strategically
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Replaces consistently poor performers

### Recommendation Scoring

Each suggestion includes:
- **Confidence Level**: 0.0-1.0 reliability score
- **Expected Impact**: Projected revenue improvement
- **Placement Rationale**: Why this product suits the position
- **Performance Comparison**: Current vs. recommended performance

## Using Real-time Scoring

### Live Feedback System

As you work with your planogram, the AI assistant provides continuous feedback:

1. **Drag and Drop Scoring**: Scores update when you move products
2. **Immediate Suggestions**: Get tips for each placement decision
3. **Comparative Analysis**: See how changes affect overall performance

### Interpreting Score Changes

- **Score Increases**: Green indicators show positive changes
- **Score Decreases**: Red warnings highlight potential issues
- **Neutral Changes**: Yellow indicators suggest minimal impact

### Optimization Tips from Real-time Feedback

- **Premium Positions**: Use Row A for highest-velocity products
- **Category Mixing**: Avoid clustering similar products
- **Complementary Placement**: Position related items near each other
- **Empty Slot Focus**: Prioritize filling vacant positions

## Heat Map Visualization

### Understanding Heat Zones

The heat map feature visually represents slot performance potential:

- **Red Zones**: Lower performance areas
- **Yellow Zones**: Moderate performance potential
- **Green Zones**: High-performance positions

### Activating Heat Map

1. **Click "Toggle Heat Map"** in the AI panel
2. **Wait for Data Loading**: System calculates zone performance
3. **View Overlay**: Heat zones appear over your planogram grid
4. **Interpret Colors**: Use the color coding to guide placement decisions

### Using Heat Map Data

- **Product Placement**: Put high-margin items in green zones
- **Strategic Positioning**: Avoid placing premium products in red zones
- **Layout Optimization**: Redesign cabinet configuration based on heat patterns
- **Performance Validation**: Confirm current placements align with heat data

## Auto-Optimization Features
