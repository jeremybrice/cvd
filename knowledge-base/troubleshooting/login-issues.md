# Login and Authentication Issues

This guide helps you resolve common login and authentication problems in the CVD system.

## Common Login Problems

### Problem: "Invalid username or password" Error

**Symptoms:**

- Unable to access the system despite correct credentials

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Credentials**

   - Try typing password in a text editor to verify

2. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Clear cookies and cached data
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Disable browser extensions temporarily

3. **Account Status Check**
   - Contact your administrator to verify account is active
   - Check if account has been temporarily locked
   - Confirm account hasn't been suspended

### Problem: Account Locked After Failed Attempts

**Symptoms:**
- "Account locked" message appears
- Unable to login even with correct credentials
- Security lockout notification

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for Automatic Unlock**
   - Accounts automatically unlock after 15 minutes
   - Avoid repeated attempts during lockout period
   - Clear browser cache while waiting

2. **Administrator Reset**

   - Request immediate account unlock
   - Administrator can reset lockout through user management

3. **Prevention**
