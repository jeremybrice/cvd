# Creating Your First Planogram

A planogram is the visual representation of how products are arranged in your vending machine cabinets. This tutorial will guide you through creating an effective planogram that maximizes sales and customer satisfaction.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- At least one device configured in the system
- Product catalog set up (12 system products are available by default)
- Understanding of your device's cabinet layout

### What You'll Learn
- How to select and configure a planogram
- Product placement strategies
- Setting par levels and pricing
- Using drag-and-drop functionality
- Best practices for product arrangement

## Step 1: Navigate to Planogram Management

1. **Click "Planogram"** in the main navigation menu
2. **Wait for the page to load** - you'll see the planogram interface
3. **Familiarize yourself** with the layout:
   - Device/Cabinet selector (top left)
   - Product catalog (left sidebar)
   - Planogram grid (center area)
   - Product details panel (right)

## Step 2: Select Your Device and Cabinet

1. **Click the Device dropdown** at the top of the page
2. **Choose your device** from the list
3. **Select the cabinet** you want to configure
   - Cooler cabinets: 5×8 layout (40 slots)
   - Ambient+ cabinets: 6×9 layout (54 slots)
   - Other cabinet types as configured

4. **Confirm the planogram loads** - you should see an empty grid matching your cabinet layout

## Step 3: Understanding the Product Catalog

The left sidebar contains your product catalog organized by categories:

### Available Categories
- **Beverages**: Soft drinks, water, energy drinks
- **Snacks**: Chips, crackers, nuts
- **Candy**: Chocolate, gum, sweet treats
- **Healthy**: Protein bars, fruit snacks
- **Food**: Sandwiches, prepared meals (if applicable)

### Product Information
Each product shows:
- **Name and image**
- **Category**  
- **Suggested retail price**
- **Drag handle** for placement

## Step 4: Basic Product Placement

### Drag and Drop Method
1. **Click and hold** a product in the catalog
2. **Drag it** to an empty slot in the planogram grid
3. **Release** to place the product
4. **Confirm placement** - the slot should now show the product

### Alternative Placement Method
1. **Click on an empty slot** in the grid
2. **Select a product** from the catalog popup
3. **Confirm selection** to place the product

## Step 5: Configure Product Details

After placing a product, configure its slot settings:

### Quantity Settings
- **Current Stock**: How many items are currently in the slot
- **Par Level**: Minimum stock before restocking is needed
- **Capacity**: Maximum items the slot can hold

### Pricing Configuration
- **Price**: Individual item price (can override catalog price)
- **Special Pricing**: Promotional or bulk pricing if applicable

### Best Practice Settings
- **Par Level**: Set to 60-70% of capacity for optimal restocking
- **Current Stock**: Start with full capacity
- **Pricing**: Use suggested retail prices or adjust based on location

## Step 6: Strategic Product Placement

### Eye-Level Positioning
- **Place popular items** at eye level (middle rows)
- **Position bestsellers** in easily accessible slots
- **Use prime real estate** for high-margin products

### Category Organization
- **Group similar products** together
- **Create logical flows** (beverages → snacks → candy)
- **Balance variety** across the planogram

### Sales Optimization
- **Popular items**: Central, eye-level positions
- **Impulse purchases**: Near payment area
- **Healthy options**: Visible but not dominant
- **High-margin items**: Premium positions

## Step 7: Using AI Suggestions (If Available)

If your system has AI optimization enabled:

1. **Click "Get AI Suggestions"** button
2. **Review recommendations** based on:
   - Historical sales data
   - Product performance
   - Seasonal trends
   - Location factors

3. **Apply suggestions selectively**:
   - Consider local preferences
   - Account for physical constraints
   - Test recommendations gradually

## Step 8: Review and Finalize

### Quality Check
- **Verify all slots** are filled appropriately
- **Check par levels** are realistic
- **Confirm pricing** is correct
- **Review product mix** for variety

### Auto-Save Feature
- **Changes save automatically** - no manual save needed
- **Green indicator** shows successful saves
- **Red indicator** shows connection issues

## Advanced Planogram Techniques

### Seasonal Adjustments
- **Summer**: Increase cold beverages and water
- **Winter**: Add hot chocolate, coffee products (if available)
- **Holidays**: Include seasonal snacks and treats

### Performance-Based Optimization
- **Monitor sales data** through analytics
- **Adjust slow-moving products** to better positions
- **Replace poor performers** with proven sellers
- **Test new products** in prime slots temporarily

### Multi-Cabinet Strategy
For devices with multiple cabinets:
- **Dedicate cabinets** to specific categories
- **Avoid duplication** unless high demand
- **Create complementary** product mixes
- **Consider temperature** requirements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Products Won't Drag
- **Refresh the page** and try again
- **Ensure the planogram is loaded** completely
- **Check browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox recommended)

### Slots Appear Occupied
- **Clear the slot first** by clicking the X or delete button
- **Check for system products** that may be pre-loaded
- **Verify cabinet configuration** matches physical layout

### Changes Don't Save
- **Check internet connection**
- **Look for save indicators** (green = success, red = error)
- **Try refreshing and re-entering** if persistent issues

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start with popular items** in prime positions
2. **Group complementary products** together
3. **Set realistic par levels** (60-70% of capacity)
4. **Use data-driven decisions** when available
5. **Regular reviews and adjustments** based on performance
6. **Consider customer flow** and accessibility
7. **Balance variety** with proven sellers
