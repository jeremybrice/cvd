# Company Settings Hover Effect Redesign - Summary

## Problem Solved
Replaced the problematic multi-column vertical bar hover effect that created a "prison bar" appearance with a clean, modern single left-edge accent design.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Old Implementation
- **Deleted**: `tr:hover:not(.filter-row) td::after` pseudo-elements that created vertical bars between ALL columns
- **Deleted**: Old `slideIn` animation that animated bars from left on each cell
- **Removed**: Relative positioning on individual td cells during hover

### 2. New Modern Hover Effect

#### Left Edge Accent Bar
- Single 4px blue accent bar on the left edge of the row
- Uses `tr::before` pseudo-element (not td)
- Smooth `slideInLeft` animation (0.2s ease-out)
- Border radius for polished look
- Z-index and pointer-events managed

#### Enhanced Background
- Improved gradient: 135deg angle from blue (8% opacity) to lighter (3% opacity)
- Replaces the previous 90deg gradient
- Maintains visual hierarchy without overwhelming

#### Depth & Movement
- Subtle box shadow: `0 2px 8px rgba(0, 109, 254, 0.1)`
- Row shifts 2px right on hover for tactile feedback
- No layout shift issues

#### Interactive Elements
- First cell becomes bold and blue (#006dfe) on hover
- Action buttons scale to 1.05x
- Icons scale to 1.15x
- All with smooth 0.2s transitions

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Added `will-change: transform, box-shadow` for GPU acceleration
- Used transform-based animations instead of position changes
- Single animation vs multiple (one per column previously)

### 4. CSS Location
All changes in `/home/jbrice/Projects/365/pages/company-settings.html` between lines 389-441

## Technical Implementation

### Old CSS (Removed)
```css
tr:hover:not(.filter-row) td::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 3px;
    background: #006dfe;
    opacity: 0;
    animation: slideIn 0.3s forwards;
}
```

### New CSS (Added)
```css
/* Single left accent bar */
tr:hover:not(.filter-row)::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 4px;
    background: #006dfe;
    border-radius: 0 2px 2px 0;
    transform-origin: left;
    animation: slideInLeft 0.2s ease-out forwards;
    z-index: 1;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Visual**: No more vertical bars between columns
2. **Better Performance**: Single animation vs multiple
3. **Modern Design**: Follows current UI trends
4. **Improved UX**: Clear row selection without visual noise
5. **Maintained Functionality**: Filter row unaffected, text selection works

## Testing
Test file created at `/home/jbrice/Projects/365/test-hover-effect.html` for verification of all hover effects across the three tables (Locations, Routes, Products).

## Browser Compatibility
Works in all modern browsers supporting CSS3 transforms and animations:
- Chrome/Edge 
- Firefox
- Safari

No polyfills needed as these are standard CSS3 features.
